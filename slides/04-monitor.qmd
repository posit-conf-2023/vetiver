## Plan for this workshop

::: nonincremental
-   *Versioning*
    -   Managing change in models ✅
-   *Deploying*
    -   Putting models in REST APIs 🎯
-   *Monitoring*
    -   Tracking model performance 👀
:::

## My model is performing well!

. . .

👩🏼‍🔧 My model returns predictions quickly, doesn't use too much memory or processing power, and doesn't have outages.

. . .

### Metrics

- latency
- memory and CPU usage
- uptime

## My model is performing well! 

. . .

👩🏽‍🔬 My model returns predictions that are close to the true values for the predicted quantity.

. . .

### Metrics

- accuracy
- ROC AUC
- F1 score
- RMSE
- log loss

## Feedback loops 🔁

- Users take some action as a result of a prediction
- Users rate or correct the quality of a prediction
- Produce annotations (crowdsource or expert)
- Produce feedback automatically

## Your turn 🏺 {transition="slide-in"}

*What is a possible feedback loop for the Chicago inspections data?*

*Do you think your example would be harmful or helpful?*

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5)

## Connect model metrics to business outcomes

tktk

## Possible model monitoring artifacts

- Adhoc analysis that you post in Slack
- Report that you share in Google Drive
- Fully automated dashboard published to Posit Connect

## Possible model monitoring artifacts
