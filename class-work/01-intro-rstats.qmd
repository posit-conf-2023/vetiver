## Explore the data 👀

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
path <- here::here("data", "inspections.parquet")
inspections <- read_parquet(path)
glimpse(inspections)
```

Explore the `inspections` data on your own!

```{r}
inspections |> 
  count(results)
```

```{r}
## more EDA here
```

## Build a model 🔧

Spend your data budget:

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
set.seed(123)
inspect_split <- initial_split(inspections, prop = 0.8)
inspect_train <- training(inspect_split)
inspect_test <- testing(inspect_split)
```

Train a logistic regression model:

```{r}
inspection_rec <- 
  recipe(results ~ facility_type + risk + total_violations + inspection_date, 
         data = inspect_train) |> 
  step_date(inspection_date, features = c("month", "year"), keep_original_cols = FALSE)

inspection_fit <-
  workflow(inspection_rec, logistic_reg()) |> 
  fit(data = inspect_train)
```

## Create a deployable model object 🏺

```{r}
library(vetiver)
v <- vetiver_model(___, ___)
v
```

```{r}
## create a vetiver model with a custom description
```

## Version your model 📌

```{r}
library(pins)

board <- ___
board |> ___(v)
```

```{r}
## retrieve your model metadata
board |> pin_meta(___)
```

## Publish your model on Posit Connect 🚀

- Create an API key on Connect: <https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/>
- Store it as `CONNECT_API_KEY` in `.Renviron`

```{r}
## now write your model pin to Posit Connect
board <- ___
board |> ___(v)
```

Visit your pin's homepage on Connect.

## Store a new version 👯

Train your model with a new algorithm:

```{r}
inspection_fit <-
  workflow(inspection_rec, ___) |> 
  fit(data = inspect_train)
```

Store this new model as a new version of the same pin:

```{r}
v <- vetiver_model(___, ___)
board |> ___(v)
```

What versions do you have?

```{r}
board |> pin_versions()
```
